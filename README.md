# image_caption_COCO2017
- Dataset MSCOCO2017 (Annotations + Images): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3NYCN81RDSQmipBGwt2D1oW3JXVVS_d?usp=sharing
- Model: CNN for Encoder and LSTM for Decoder
- COCO_2017 for train, val and test need to have the names inorder: train2017, val2017, test2017
- Disadvantage of doing with COCO2017: Colab can't read images of Drive because of big dataset so I have to do it on local. But without GPU makes the tasks more difficult. So you need to have GPU when doing with COCO-dataset.
